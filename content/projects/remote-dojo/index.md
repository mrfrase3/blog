This application provided a way for CoderDojo mentors to provide assistance to kids learning to code in remote and rural communities.

It uses WebRTC to allow a child to have a call with the mentor where they can do things like send messages, code snippets, and share their screen.
Importantly, this application did not have support for the child to share their webcam, for privacy reasons.

Children requiring help would join a queue, and the mentors would see this and accept the calls and help accordingly.

This was a project as a part of the professional computing unit at UWA, the project continued after the unit was completed.
